Trans-Seq is a circuit mapping method that allows for transcriptomically profiling of postsynaptically connected neurons. Trans-Seq combines a fluorescent anterograde transsynaptic tracer, consisting of codon-optimized wheat germ agglutinin  fused  to  mCherry,  with  single-cell  RNA  Sequencing. Connected neurons are recovered via FACS based on mCherry fluorescence. In our study, we  used  Trans-Seq  to  classify neuron types in the superior colliculus innervated by genetically-defined RGC types and predicted a neuronal pair from Î±RGCs to Nephronectin-positive wide-field neurons (NPWFs).
